### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! I used all the topics used in the labs. I felt prepared to finish everything, It was just a matter of more time to debug.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have finished the featured playlist page. I couldn't figure out how to make it.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My playlist display went very well. I didn't plan on not being able to finish the featured playlist page, i had a difficult time. I saw peers implement a search bar which I would have liked to add.
